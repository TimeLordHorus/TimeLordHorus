### End-to-End Encryption 🔒
Protect your browsing data from host browser collection using military-grade encryption.

#### How to Enable Encryption:
1. **Open Settings**: Click the gear (⚙️) icon
2. **Navigate to Encryption Section**: Scroll to "End-to-End Encryption"
3. **Enable Encryption**: Click "🔐 Enable Encryption"
4. **Set Master Password**: Enter a strong password (minimum 8 characters)
5. **Confirm Password**: Re-enter to confirm
6. **Data Encryption**: All existing data is automatically encrypted

#### Encryption Features:
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Military-grade encryption algorithm
- **PBKDF2 Key Derivation**: 100,000 iterations for strong key generation
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Your password is NEVER stored anywhere
- **Encrypted Data Storage**: Bookmarks, history, and settings are encrypted
- **Privacy Mode**: Automatically encrypt all data with one toggle
- **Password Protection**: Only you can access your encrypted data

#### What Gets Encrypted:
- ✅ All bookmarks (titles, URLs, timestamps)
- ✅ Complete browsing history
- ✅ Browser settings and preferences
- ✅ Tab groups and organization data
- ✅ File manager metadata
- ✅ Download history
- ✅ Custom filters and preferences

#### How Encryption Works:

**Encryption Process:**
1. You provide a master password
2. Password is hashed using PBKDF2 (100,000 iterations + random salt)
3. A 256-bit AES key is derived from the hash
4. All data is encrypted using AES-GCM before storage
5. Each encryption uses a unique Initialization Vector (IV)
6. Encrypted data is stored in Base64 format

**Decryption Process:**
1. You enter your master password
2. Same key derivation process recreates the encryption key
3. Data is decrypted on-the-fly when accessed
4. Decrypted data is only in memory, never stored unencrypted

**Security Benefits:**
- 🛡️ **Host Browser Protection**: Your data is encrypted before the host browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) can collect it
- 🔐 **Local Encryption**: Data encrypted on your device before storage
- 🚫 **No Cloud Sync**: Encryption keys never leave your device
- 🔑 **Password-Only Access**: Only someone with your password can decrypt the data
- 🎯 **Zero-Knowledge**: Even if someone accesses your device storage, they cannot read encrypted data

#### Privacy Mode:
Enable Privacy Mode for automatic encryption of all data:
- One-click toggle in settings
- Automatically enables encryption if not already enabled
- All new data is encrypted by default
- Perfect for maximum privacy protection

#### Important Security Notes:

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: If you forget your master password, your encrypted data **CANNOT BE RECOVERED**. There is no password reset or recovery mechanism by design.

✅ **Best Practices:**
- Use a strong, unique password (12+ characters recommended)
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Store your password securely (password manager recommended)
- Never share your master password
- Change your password periodically using "Change Password" button

🔄 **Changing Password:**
1. Click "🔑 Change Password" in encryption settings
2. Enter current password
3. Enter new password (must be different)
4. All data is automatically re-encrypted with new password

🔓 **Disabling Encryption:**
1. Click "🔓 Disable Encryption" (requires current password)
2. Confirm you want to disable protection
3. All data is decrypted and stored unencrypted
4. WARNING: Data will be accessible to host browser after disabling

#### Technical Specifications:
- **Algorithm**: AES-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)
- **Key Length**: 256 bits
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2-SHA256
- **Iterations**: 100,000 (recommended by NIST)
- **Salt**: 128-bit random salt (unique per user)
- **IV**: 96-bit random IV (unique per encryption operation)
- **Authentication**: Built-in authentication tag (GCM mode)
- **Encoding**: Base64 for storage

#### Encryption Status Indicators:
- 🟢 **Enabled & Unlocked**: Encryption active, data accessible
- 🟡 **Enabled & Locked**: Encryption active, password required
- ⚫ **Disabled**: No encryption, data unprotected

### Settings
Access settings by clicking the gear (⚙️) icon:

- **Homepage**: Set your preferred homepage URL
- **Search Engine**: Choose your default search engine

### Key Technologies
- **IndexedDB**: Client-side database for persistent storage
- **Service Worker**: Offline functionality and caching
- **Web Bluetooth API**: Device-to-device wireless communication
- **Web Share API**: Native system sharing integration
- **File System Access API**: Local file management

## Features in Detail

### Tab Management
Each tab maintains its own:
- Navigation history
- Current URL
- Page title
- Forward/back stack

### Search Integration
Automatically detects if input is a URL or search query:
- Valid URLs (with dots, no spaces) → Direct navigation
- Everything else → Search using default engine

### Theme System
Two beautiful themes:
- **Light Theme**: Clean, minimal design for daytime use
- **Dark Theme**: Easy on the eyes for low-light environments

Themes use CSS custom properties for instant switching without page reload.

### Offline Capability
The service worker caches:
- Application shell (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Static assets
- Visited pages (optional)

This enables:
- Instant loading on repeat visits
- Offline access to cached pages
- Background sync (when supported)

## Security Considerations

### Iframe Sandbox
Content is loaded in sandboxed iframes with restrictions:
- `allow-same-origin`: Allows content to access its own origin
- `allow-scripts`: Enables JavaScript execution
- `allow-popups`: Allows pop-ups (required for some sites)
- `allow-forms`: Enables form submission

### Data Privacy
- All data stored locally in your browser
- No external servers or tracking
- Clear data options available
- Optional history tracking

### Content Security
- Protocol indicators show connection security
- HTTPS preferred for all connections
- Warning for non-secure HTTP connections

## Limitations

As a web-based browser running in another browser:
- Cannot access system-level features
- Some websites may block iframe embedding
- Limited to browser security sandbox
- Network requests subject to CORS policies
