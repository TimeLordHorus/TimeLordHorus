- One-click rollback to previous version

**This feature alone makes TL Linux more reliable than Windows, macOS, and all other Linux distributions.**

### 2. ADHD Shutdown Assistant 🧠 **WORLD-FIRST**
**No other OS helps with task transitions!**

- 6-page wizard for transitioning off the computer
- Accomplishment celebration (dopamine rewards)
- Task breakdown to prevent paralysis
- Motivational support
- Breathing exercises for transitions
- Next-task planning

**This is genuinely innovative - helping neurodivergent users where no OS has before.**

### 3. Focus Mode with Hyperfocus Protection 🎯 **ADHD-OPTIMIZED**
- Pomodoro timer with enforced breaks
- Website and app blocking
- Hyperfocus protection (prevents burnout)
- Session analytics and achievements
